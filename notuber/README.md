# Comp20 Lab: Ride-Hailing Service

This project displays a google map with the user's current location
and the locations of cars generated from the Comp20 Ride-Share API.
A line connects the user's location to the closest car, and
infowindows display the distance of each car to the user.

All functionality described by the lab instructions should be implemented
correctly. In addition, clicking on a vehicle opens an infowindow
that shows how far away it is from the user's location.

Part 1: This part took a bit over 1 hour.
Part 2: This part took 2.5 hours.
